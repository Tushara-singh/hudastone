                <p>Stairs, in a unique way, are like bridge. They connect certain location to opposite ones, 
                enabling people to go from one place to another and back. 
                They make two ends meet, being a series of steps between one level to another, 
                or from one floor to another. We simply walk or run unto them every day of our lives,
                 but do we know how important stairs are? Well I think it's time for us to know and
                  appreciate that stairs are one of the many things that should be given importance 
                  not just because it gives great visual in our house' interior but let us discover 
                  much more of stairs.

            It is important to take into account that when installed outdoors, mosaics will not take color or shine the same way they do in interiors.
            <br>
            Part of the charm of these tiles is that they are not “perfect”, that is also why they are The hydraulic mosaic is a hard material that recovers traditional manufacture by using considered handicraft materials.
