                <p>Typical construction consisted of small or mid-sized tree trunks aligned vertically, with no free space in between. The trunks were sharpened or pointed at the top, and were driven into the ground and sometimes reinforced with additional construction. The height of a palisade ranged from around a metre to as high as 3-4 m. As a defensive structure, palisades were often used in conjunction with earthworks.

Palisades were an excellent option for small forts or other hastily constructed fortifications. Since they were made of wood, they could often be quickly and easily built from readily available materials. They proved to be effective protection for short-term conflicts and were an effective deterrent against small forces. However, because they were wooden constructions they were also vulnerable to fire and siege weapons.

Often, a palisade would be constructed around a castle as a temporary wall until a permanent stone wall could be erected.

                <p>Palisade derives from pale, from the Latin word pālus, meaning stake, specifically a "stake" used to support a fence.[1] 
                A palisade gangs these side by side to create a fence entirely made of pales.
                They make two ends meet, being a series of steps between one level to another, 
                or from one floor to another. We simply walk or run unto them every day of our lives,
                 but do we know how important stairs are? Well I think it's time for us to know and
                  appreciate that stairs are one of the many things that should be given importance 
                  not just because it gives great visual in our house' interior but let us discover 
                  much more of stairs.

            In outdoors, mosaics can undergo certain discoloration and cracking due to UV rays exposure and extreme temperatures. This becomes more noticeable in violet, blue and green colors.
            <br>
            It is important to take into account that when installed outdoors, mosaics will not take color or shine the same way they do in interiors.
            <br>
            Part of the charm of these tiles is that they are not “perfect”, that is also why they are The hydraulic mosaic is a hard material that recovers traditional manufacture by using considered handicraft materials.
