                <p>Cobblestone is a natural building material based on cobble-sized stones,
                 and is used for pavement roads, streets, and buildings.. Setts, also called Belgian blocks,
                  are often casually referred to as "cobbles", although a sett is distinct from a cobblestone by being quarried or shaped to a regular form, 
                whereas cobblestone is generally of a naturally occurring form and is less uniform in size.

            In outdoors, mosaics can undergo certain discoloration and cracking due to UV rays exposure and extreme temperatures. This becomes more noticeable in violet, blue and green colors.
            <br>
            It is important to take into account that when installed outdoors, mosaics will not take color or shine the same way they do in interiors.

            Part of the charm of these tiles is that they are not “perfect”, that is also why they are The hydraulic mosaic is a hard material that recovers traditional manufacture by using considered handicraft materials.
